I am a researcher at Alibaba Tongyi Lab, working on agentic reinforcement learning, agent self-evolution systems, and LLM post-training techniques. I received my Ph.D. from Peking University, School of Computer Science in 2024.

My main research interests include:

1. <u>Agentic RL</u>: Reinforcement learning algorithms for large language models in dialogue and agent scenarios, including tool use, deep research, and software engineering
2. <u>Self-Evolving Agent Systems</u>: Self-evolving, continual learning, and autonomous improvement mechanisms for intelligent agents
3. <u>LLM Post-training</u>: Post-training and fine-tuning techniques for large language models, addressing learning stability and efficiency in long-horizon task scenarios

**Hiring**: I am looking for researchers and interns interested in agentic RL, agent self-evolution, and LLM post-training techniques. Please feel free to contact me.
