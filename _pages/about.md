I am a researcher at Alibaba Tongyi Lab, working on agentic reinforcement learning, agent self-evolution systems, and LLM post-training techniques. I received my Ph.D. from Peking University, School of Computer Science in 2024.

### Research Interests

1. **Agentic RL Algorithms**: Reinforcement learning algorithms for large language models in dialogue and agent scenarios, including tool use, coding, and software engineering
2. **Agent Self-Evolution Systems**: Self-evolving, continual learning, and autonomous improvement mechanisms for intelligent agents
3. **LLM Post-training Techniques**: Post-training and fine-tuning techniques for large language models, addressing learning stability and efficiency in long-horizon task scenarios

**Hiring**: I am looking for researchers and interns interested in agentic RL, agent self-evolution, and LLM post-training techniques. Please feel free to contact me.
